# Table-Tune-Docker
General setup for table-tune app

# table-tune - pre-install

Make sure you have linux system recommended Ubuntu.

If not you can use WSL for windows and install sub-system like Ubuntu.

**WSL**

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following commands to install WSL:

1. wsl --install -> This will install both WSL 2 and Ubuntu
2. IF NOT than: wsl --install Ubuntu-24.04 -> current version
3. wsl --set-default-version 2 -> update to version 2
4. wsl --list --verbose -> After installation, verify that WSL 2 is installed by running

You should see something like:

NAME * Ubuntu
STATE *Running
VERSION *2

Check: wsl -l -v

This will list all installed WSL distributions. If Ubuntu is installed correctly, it should appear in the list.

(Maybe need to restart pc to apply changes)

Once done search for Ubuntu in start menu

# Docker

Make sure you have a docker with compose

Follow the official documentation (recommended): **[Docker-Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)**

Verify installation:

docker --version
docker-compose --version

Check if your user has docker permissions:
groups or id -nG (should see **docker**)

Check docker daemon status (To check if the Docker service is running and if permissions are set correctly):
sudo service docker status

or for WSL:
sudo service docker status

Check docker permissions on unix socket:
ls -l /var/run/docker.sock

output should look like: srw-rw---- 1 root docker 0 Mar 9 10:30 /var/run/docker.sock
It means only root and users in the docker group can access it.

Check user permissions on docker executable:
ls -l $(which docker)
This will show the permissions of the Docker binary.

**Additionally, follow this commands to install docker:**

Open Ubuntu terminal and run:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg

Now, add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key and repository:

sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc > /dev/null
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update

Docker dependencies:
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

After installation, to start Docker and allow your user ($USER) to use it without sudo:

sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Restart WSL instance:

exit
wsl --shutdown

Reopen Ubuntu terminal nad verify docker works:

docker --version
docker run hello-world

# GITHUB
Make sure your git is installed and gitHub profile is set up and ready to be used.

Before proceeding you need to generate a personal access token here: **[Generate PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens)**
Add it to .env file

# Init table-tune

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to repo root directory
3. Add .env file with credentials (not necessary)
4. Make sure ./make.sh is executable (chmod +x make.sh)
5. Run sudo ./make.sh and follow the instructions

Your setup should now be complete!
